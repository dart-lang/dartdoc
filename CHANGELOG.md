## 0.37.0
* Change scope for the dartdoc warning configuration to the library
  being documented rather than where the symbol was originally
  defined. (#2432, #2428)
* **Breaking change**: Correct null dereference exception on unusual
  import URIs through change to PackageGraph.allLibraries. (#2429, #2426)
* Adding (as yet unused) code for `mustachio`, a builder for mustache
  templates. (#2417, #2421, #2427, #2430, #2434).
* Corrected a problem with tests erroneously passing in the grinder on
  latest SDK. (#2422, #2423, #2424)

## 0.36.2

* Tag `Null safety` only where the code is actually null safe. (#2411, #2403)
* Infrastructure and minor cleanups. (#2414, #2413, #2412)

## 0.36.1

* Fix NPE in `Accessor.computeDocumentationComment` when encountering
  static fields in extension methods (#2402, #2404)

## 0.36.0

* Fix problem with linking to non-canonical elements via documentation
  references. (#2397, #2389)
* Allow for markdown 3.0.0. (#2394)
* **Breaking change** Behavior of `--exclude-packages` is changed so that
  packages so excluded will never be treated as "remote".  This version is now
  incompatible with old workarounds for #1431 (and those workarounds are no
  longer needed). Also removes `PackageGraph.packageDocumentedFor`.
  (#2387, #2382, #1431)
* Enable NNBD support by default in dartdoc.  If a package is non-nullable,
  it will now be documented that way (with null safety tags).  No change in
  behavior for packages that have not been migrated. (#2384)
* **Breaking change** Adjust interfaces for mustache and remove constant
  templates, including removing `TemplateData.packageGraph`. (#2375, #2373,
  #2379)
* Internal type changes for upcoming analyzer 0.41 (#2380, #2392)
* **Breaking change** Remove typeParameters setter for ModelFunctionTyped and
  change Typedef inheritance (#2376)

## 0.35.0

* Update Dart analyzer version to 0.40+ and update minimum Dart version
  to 2.10. (#2372)
* Add a `nodoc` option in `dartdoc_options.yaml` to prevent all symbols
  declared in a file from ever being documented, similar to using `@nodoc`
  (#2369, #2368, #2266, #2355)
* Some template interface refactors preparing for mustache changes to drop
  use of dart:mirrors. (#2371, #2370)
* Add an feature to allow declaring a `DartdocOption`'s value to be a glob.
  (#2365)
  * **Breaking change**: The `DartdocOption` constructor interface has changed
    so it uses an enum instead of individual `isFile` and `isDir`.
* Emit a warning rather than throwing a fatal error for a package with
  no libraries. (#2360, #2327)
* Fix several problems with implementation chain display when there are
  intermediate private classes (#2358, #2290, #2094, #2354, #1623)
* Fix a deadlock in `MultiFutureTracker`. (#2351)
* Cache exclude values and known parts. (#2347)

## 0.34.0

* PackageConfigProvider, MockSdk, etc for improved unit testing (#2332)
  * The new PackageConfigProvider class abstracts over PackageConfig from
    `package_config`. PhysicalPackageConfigProvider uses the real one;
    MemoryPackageConfigProvider is used in tests.
  * The new `isSdkLibraryDocumented` abstracts over SdkLibrary's
    `isDocumented`, because it throws unimplemented for `MockSdkLibrary`.
  * Remove `ResourceProviderExtensions.defaultSdkDir`. Now this is a property
    of PackageMetaProvider.
  * **Breaking change**: Move `io_utils` `listDir` to be a private method in
    PackageBuilder.
  * **Breaking change**: Add parameter to PubPackageBuilder constructor for a
    PackageConfigProvider.
  * **Breaking change**: Add two parameters to the PackageMetaProvider
    constructor, one for the default SDK directory, and one for the DartSdk.
  * Deprecate package.dart's `substituteNameVersion`.
  * Shorten doc comments here and there to 80 columns.
  * Move any tests which use `testing/test_package_small` to be unit tests;
    delete the package in `testing/`.
  * Move some tests for properties of package which use the ginormous testing
    package to unit tests
* Add a warning when an unknown directive is parsed in a comment. (#2340)

## 0.33.0

* Remove a use of resource loading (#2337)
* Remove some unused dependencies (#2334)
* Use the terminal width for the line length (#2333)
* Disambiguate between named constructor and field (#2331)
* Rename some fields which erroneously reference "default" constructors.
  (#2330)
* Support abstract fields (#2329)
* Allow ? and ! to trail in doc comment references (#2328)
* Use first element in a MultiplyDefinedElement (#2326)
* Update all (approximately) i/o operations to use ResourceProvider (#2315):
  * **Breaking change**: Many classes have a new ResourceProvider
    resourceProvider field: DartdocFileWriter, SnapshotCache,
    DartToolDefinition, ToolConfiguration, DartdocOption, PackageMetaProvider,
    PackageMeta, ToolTempFileTracker.
  * **Breaking change**: Each of SnapshotCache and ToolTempFileTracker has a
    static instance field which took no arguments; now that they need a
    ResourceProvider, it was unwieldy to pass a ResourceProvider to get the
    instance each time, so a new method, createInstance creates the instance.
* Remove wbr tags around block-displayed elements (#2320)
* Warn when the defining library cannot be found (#2319)
* Improve error when `FLUTTER_ROOT` is missing. (#2316)
* Remove dependency on deprecated resource package. (#2314)
* Link const annotations to their docs (#2313)

    public method `Category.fileType`.
  * Deprecate the unused methods `Category.linkedName` and
    `Category.categoryLabel`.

  * Deprecate the public methods `Library.getDefinedElements`,
    `Library.getLibraryName`, and getter
    `Library.allOriginalModelElementNames`.

    `libraryNameRegexp`, `partOfRegexp`, `newLinePartOfRegexp`
  * Deprecate the public top-level field in `categorization.dart`:
    `categoryRegexp`
  * Deprecate the public top-level fields in `model_element.dart`:
    `needsPrecacheRegExp`, `htmlInjectRegExp`, `macroRegExp`
  * Deprecate the public top-level field in `source_linker.dart`:
    `uriTemplateRegexp`

* Hide non-local embedded SDKs, preventing Flutter's sky_engine from
  being documented by default with Flutter packages (#1949, #2175).
* Fix a problem with reentrance on TopLevelVariable doc caching. (#2173, #2143)
* A batch of tweaks for the new markdown output templates (#2162)

## 0.30.3
* Add support for `Never` type from analyzer (#2167, #2170).
* First markdown renderers landed (#2152) and dartdoc can sometimes
  generate markdown, but it is not ready for prime-time yet.

* BREAKING CHANGE: no longer use `<base href>` in generated documentation, instead
  use real relative links.  This may break manually constructed links that rely

## 0.11.0

* Fix resolution of ambiguous classes where the analyzer can help us. #1397
* Many cleanups to dartdoc stdout/stderr, error messages, and warnings:
  * Display fatal errors with 'fatal error' string to distinguish them from ordinary errors
  * Upgrades to new Package.warn system.
    * Fully integrated all scattered "warnings" (#1369) and added new ones for the link checker.
    * Allow for setting which warnings are errors in the library.
    * Change location output to something IntelliJ can understand and link to
    * Display location output for all warnings including line number plus column, when available
      from analyzer (still some bugs in our resolution). It still doesn't do code references quite
      right but at least gets you to the neighborhood.
    * Add a warn method to ModelElements so they can warn on themselves without help from the
      Package.
    * Warn correctly and squelch duplicates across doc inheritance and canonicalization almost
      everywhere.
    * Change --show-warnings to show all warnings, even those that might not be useful yet.
  * Display a count of all warnings/errors after document generation.
  * Make the progress counter tick slower.
* Added a built-in link checker and orphaned file checker, and tied it into Package.warn so
  that when debugging dartdoc we can breakpoint and discover what about that ModelElement
  caused us to create the broken link. (#1380)

* Squish some bugs related to duplicate logic for instantiating inherited class members.
  * Enum and a few other places could still generate duplicate ModelElements for the
    same thing.  This is now fixed.
  * EnumField is now handled by ModelElement.from factory, fixing #1239.
  * Added hints for EnumField and Accessors (index, enclosingCombo) to offload the buggy
    logic for figuring this out from callers to ModelElement.from.
* Fix broken link generation when a canonical class's defining library isn't canonical.
* Partial rewrite of GetterSetterCombo and Fields/TopLevelVariable handling
  * Link correctly to generic types for Fields/TopLevelVariables.
  * Use right, left, and bidirectional arrows for read-only, write-only, and read-write
    parameters.
* Partial rewrite of comment reference system (#1391, #1285 partial)
  * Handle gracefully a variety of things users try in the real world, like prefixing operators
    with 'operator', embedded newlines in comment references, and cases that shouldn't be
    considered at all (comment refs that are really array references in sample docs, etc).
  * Handle canonicalization correctly for comment references: point to the right places and
    only to canonical elements.
  * In general, warnings related to comment references should be much more useful now. (#1343)
    * Many fewer ambiguous doc reference warnings now and the ones that exist should be more
      easily understandable and fixable with the new warning message.
    * Understand references to parameters even though we don't do anything useful with them just yet
    * Generics outside square brackets (#1250) are now warned with better context information that
      takes newlines into account, but there are so many of them in complex packages like Flutter
      that we still only show those with --show-warnings.
  * Cache the traversal of allModelElements.
  * Change handling of enum constant linking in codeRefs to work properly, though warnings about
    that aren't right in some edge cases still.
  * Only use analyzer resolving of commentRefs as a last resort since they don't take dartdoc
    canonicalization into account.
* Added a new `--footer-text` command-line option, to allow adding additional
  text in the package name and copyright section of the footer.
* Reduced stack depth by not recomputing findCanonicalLibraryFor. (#1381)
* Workaround for (#1367) forces on enableAssertInitializer.
* Work around analyzer-0.29 bug where embedded SDK uri's aren't properly
  reversed.

## 0.10.0

* fix canonicalization problems and related issues introduced or not addressed
  in 0.9.11, including:
  * (#1361), (#1232), (#1239 (partial))- Broken links in enums
  * (#1345) and (#1090)- Reexports have wrong links in many places
  * (#1341), (#1197 (partial)) - Duplicate docs still in some cases
  * (#1334) - Some classes don't list their subclasses
  * Inheritable class members had incorrect canonicalization in many cases
  * ... and many other unfiled bugs relating to inheritance and duplicate files.
* Dartdoc no longer creates documentation for a given identifier more than once.
  This means dartdoc is 20-30% faster on complex packages.
* --auto-include-dependencies is now recursive past one layer (#589) It now drills
  all the way down and will dive into the SDK and other packages.
* Change display of warnings to be more consistent; warnings now always
  go to stderr and are printed on their own line.
* Dartdoc now warns when it is unable to find a canonical object to link to
* Dartdoc now warns if a package exports an identifier so that it is
  ambiguous which one should be treated as canonical
* Dartdoc now has a number of asserts in checked mode for issues solved
  and as-yet-unsolved, including (#1367) or canonicalization problems; try
  running in checked mode if you see structural problems in generated docs and
  see if an assert fires.
* Dartdoc internals have changed significantly:
  * Package now owns the calculation of recursive dependencies with a factory
    constructor, Package.withAutoincludedDependencies.
  * ModelElements and Libraries now have Package-scoped caches.
  * ModelElements and their subclasses now must be constructed from a single
    factory, ModelElements.from
  * Package has new methods to assist canonicalization, including
    findCanonicalLibraryFor and findCanonicalModelElementFor.
  * New mixin "Inheritable" helps class members calculate canonicalization
    for inheritable members
* change order of library, class, and enum members on displayed pages (#1323).
* change order of categories when using --use-categories, prioritizing
  this package first, the SDK second, packages with this package's name
  embedded third, and finally all other packages.  A new flag,
  --category-order, lets you change what order categories appear in. (#1323)
* fix broken masthead links in enums (#1225).
