# Writing Dart API Documentation

When asked to write or update documentation for Dart code, you must strictly follow these formatting rules based on the "Effective Dart: Documentation" guidelines.

## 1. Scope and Structure
*   **Target Public APIs:** Focus your documentation efforts on public declarations. Do not document private members (those starting with an underscore `_`) unless explicitly instructed, as they do not appear in generated API reference sites.
*   **Always use `///`:** Use `///` consecutive line comments for all API documentation. Never use `/** ... */` block comments.
*   **Proper Sentences:** Format all comments like proper sentences. Capitalize the first word (unless it's a lowercase identifier) and end with a period.
*   **The First Paragraph:** The first paragraph of a doc comment must be a single, concise sentence that summarizes the element. End it with a period. Dartdoc extracts this verbatim for list views.
*   **Separation:** Always separate the first sentence summary from the rest of the documentation with a blank line (`///`).

## 2. Tone and Openers
*   **Noun phrases for properties:** Start descriptions of variables, getters, or setters with a noun phrase.
    `/// The radius of the sphere.` (Not "Gets the radius...")
*   **"Whether" for booleans:** Start documentation for boolean properties with "Whether".
    `/// Whether the connection is active.`
*   **Third-person verbs for methods:** Start descriptions of methods or functions with a third-person verb that describes what it does.
    `/// Initializes the database.` (Not "Initialize" or "This method initializes").
*   **Avoid redundancy:** Do not restate the signature or the element name. Do not say "This class is a..." or "The foo method does...".

## 3. Strict Anti-Patterns (Banned)
*   **No `@param` or `@return`:** Never use Javadoc-style tags. Instead, weave the parameter names into the prose of the description.
    *   *Bad:* `/// @param id The ID to fetch.`
    *   *Good:* `/// Fetches the user matching the given [id].`

## 4. Technical Placement & Resolution
*   **Annotations (`@override`, etc.):** Doc comments must be placed before metadata annotations.
*   **Getter/Setter Pairs:** If a property has both a getter and a setter, place the documentation only on the getter. Tooling will emit a warning if both are documented.
*   **Default Constructors:** To link to a default, unnamed constructor in doc comments, you must use the `.new` syntax (e.g., `[ClassName.new]`).

## 5. Linking and Markdown
*   **Bracketed Links:** Use square brackets `[name]` to link to any class, method, or variable in scope.
    `/// Similar to [String.contains].`
*   **Out-of-Scope Links:** If you need to link to a symbol that is not imported by the current library, use the `@docImport` directive at the top of the file (on the `library;` declaration) rather than adding a standard `import`.
*   **Code Blocks:** For code samples, always label the language fence. Use ```` ```dart ```` for Dart, or ```` ```sh ```` for shell commands. Do not leave code blocks unlabelled, as Dartdoc will attempt to auto-detect the language and frequently guesses wrong.
*   **Formatting:** Use standard Markdown (bold, lists, etc.) after the first paragraph to fully explain edge cases, exceptions thrown, and internal behavior the caller cannot see.

## Examples

### 1. Banned Tags vs. Prose
**Bad:**
```dart
/// This method fetches data.
/// @param force true to force reload.
/// @return the data
Data load(bool force) { ... }
```
**Good:**
```dart
/// Fetches the remote data.
///
/// If [force] is true, this bypasses the local cache and forces a
/// network request.
///
/// Throws a [NetworkException] if the host is unreachable.
Data load(bool force) { ... }
```

### 2. The Annotation Placement Trap
**Bad:**
```dart
@override
/// Renders the widget to the screen.
Widget build(BuildContext context) { ... }
```
**Good:**
```dart
/// Renders the widget to the screen.
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) { ... }
```

### 3. Openers and Tone
**Bad:**
```dart
/// Gets if the connection is active.
bool get isActive => _active;

/// This method initializes the connection.
void init() { ... }
```
**Good:**
```dart
/// Whether the connection is active.
bool get isActive => _active;

/// Initializes the connection.
void init() { ... }
```

### 4. Constructor Linking
**Bad:**
```dart
/// Creates a new user. Similar to calling [User()].
User.create() { ... }
```
**Good:**
```dart
/// Creates a new user. Similar to calling [User.new].
User.create() { ... }
```

### 5. Out-of-Scope Links (@docImport)
**Bad:**
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart'; // Adds unnecessary runtime dependency just for docs

/// To use this, you must pass a [Client].
```
**Good:**
```dart
/// @docImport 'package:http/http.dart';
library;

/// To use this, you must pass a [Client].
```
