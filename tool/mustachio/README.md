# Mustachio

_Mustachio_ is a code generation-based Mustache render system designed with
Dartdoc's needs in mind.

## Mustache background

[Mustache templating][] takes a _context object_ and renders it into a
_template_. For example, an instance of the Library class can be rendered into
the `library.html` template file. Mustache is primarily a templating syntax,
where tags specify how _keys_ on the context object are rendered into the
template. For example, consider the following template:

```mustache
<h1>{{ name }}</h1>
{{ #hasDetails }}
<ul>
  {{ #details }}
  <li>{{ text }}</li>
  {{ /details }}
</ul>
{{ /hasDetails }}
```

Mustache specifies that `{{ name }}` represents a _variable_ tag, where the
value of the context object's `name` property is interpolated into the
template. `{{ #hasDetails }}` and `{{ #details }}` each specify a _section_ tag,
where the template content between `{{ #hasDetails }}` and `{{ /hasDetails }}`
is rendered zero, one, or multiple times, possibly with a new context object,
depending on the value of the context object's `hasDetails` property. The catch
is in how a Dart program can access a property of an object via a
runtime-derived String name.

The two popular Mustache packages for Dart ([mustache][] and [mustache4dart][])
each use [mirrors][], which is slow, and whose future is unknown. The
[mustache_template][] package avoids mirrors by restricting context objects to
just Maps and Lists of values. Neither of these existing solutions were optimal
for Dartdoc. For a time, dartdoc used the mustache package. When dartdoc creates
documentation for a package, the majority of the time is spent generating the
HTML output from package metadata. Benchmarking shows that much time is spent
using mirrors.

## Motivation

The primary motivation to design a new template rendering solution is to reduce
the time to generate package documentation. In mid-2020, on a current MacBook
Pro, it took 12 minutes to generate the Flutter documentation. A solution which
uses static dispatch instead of mirrors's runtime reflection will be much
faster. A prototype demonstrated that a new system which parses templates
ahead-of-time against known context types could render the Flutter documentation
in 3 minutes.

There are several secondary benefits:

* **Correct static typing** - a solution which uses property access on
  statically typed objects ensures that properties (getters, specifically)
  exist, illuminating typos.
* **Property usage** - a solution which uses normal property access (calling
  getters) on statically typed objects allows analyzers and IDEs to understand
  when a property is referenced within a template. This is required for
  automated refactoring, finding references, finding definition, and “unused”
  static analysis.
* **The possibility to restrict API usage** - currently, any custom template
  which a package author writes can walk the entire UML diagram of dartdoc's
  internals, and any types which can be accessed via public properties from the
  primary ModelElement types. This reaches out to include hundreds of types, and
  tens of thousands of properties. A code-generation solution allows dartdoc to
  declare only a supported, restricted subset.

## Mustache's dynamically typed background

Mustache was originally authored as a templating system to be used in
JavaScript. JavaScript's dynamic typing and use of objects and object properties
lends itself to simple ideas in parsing Mustache. A renderer can request from
any object a property with a String name parsed from a Mustache template
string. JavaScript also has notions of “falsey” and “truthy” which are used in
rendering sections and inverted sections.

This design is a perfect fit for JavaScript. A Mustache renderer for Dart which
accesses properties in "the normal way" (not using mirrors, and not using
dynamic dispatch) requires a non-trivial design. In fact, the two code-generated
renderer designs provided here each require ahead-of-time knowledge of the
complete set of types which may be rendered with Mustache templates. No design
is given for a Mustache renderer which can render arbitrary objects.

## Design overview

### Two rendering methods

When dartdoc generates documentation for a package, it renders context objects
using Mustache templates. For example, an EnumTemplateData instance (for a
specific enum) is rendered using a file, `enum.html`. When generating
documentation for api.dart.dev, pub.dev, and api.flutter.dev, standard, static
templates are used. When generating documentation for Fuchsia, custom templates
are used, which are only known and resolved at runtime.

Two code generation-based rendering methods are designed below. The first
design is for a tool which can generate the code to render objects of specific
types using runtime-interpreted Mustache template blocks. The second design is
for a tool which can generate the code to render objects of specific types using
pre-compiled Mustache template blocks.

**The first tool generates code specific to one set of known types, one renderer
per type.** Each generated renderer accepts an instance of the appropriate type,
and a Mustache template block.

The renderers access properties of objects via normal Dart property access
(without reflection, and without dynamic dispatch), but require complete
mappings from property names to property accessors for each type.

**The second tool generates code specific to one set of known types, and one
set of known templates and partials, one renderer per type-template pair.** Each
generated renderer accepts an instance of the appropriate type. Each template is
pre-encoded into the appropriate renderer, including the parse tree and all key
resolution.

The renderers access properties of objects via normal Dart property access
(without reflection, and without dynamic dispatch).

When using the standard templates to generate documentation, Dartdoc can make
use of the pre-compiled renderers. When using custom templates to generate
documentation, Dartdoc must make use of the renderers which interpret template
blocks at runtime.

## Limitations

Dartdoc's standard templates do not use all features of Mustache. Ergo,
Mustachio does not support all features of Mustache. Namely:

* no support for Lambda tags
* no support for Set Delimiter tags
* no support for resolving Map keys or List indexes

## Parser

The Mustache parser is shared between the two code-generation methods. Parsing
a Mustache template block of text (from a template or a partial) into a syntax
tree, without resolving keys, is a solved problem; Mustachio's [Parser] is not
novel.

The output of this parser is a syntax tree consisting of the following node
types:

* [Text][] node - plain text as it appears in the template
* [Variable][] node - a node containing the variable tag key
* [Section][] node - a node containing the section tag key, whether the section
  tag is inverted, and the syntax tree of the section block
* [Partial][] node - a node containing the partial tag key

[Partial]: https://github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc/blob/main/lib/src/mustachio/parser.dart#L477

## Generated renderer for a specific type which interprets templates at runtime

Mustachio's first set of generated renderers render objects into
runtime-interpreted Mustache template blocks. Each template block may be the
content of a Mustache template file, a Mustache partial file, or a Mustache
section.

The mechanics of the tool which generates these renderers is a separate concern
from the mechanics of the renderers themselves. This section is primarily
concerned with documenting how the renderers work. At the end, a higher level
description of the code generator can be found.

### Example types

Any examples in this section will use the following types:

```dart
abstract class User {
  String get name;
  UserProfile get profile;
  bool get isFeatured;
  List<Post>? get posts;
  Post? featuredPost;
}

abstract class UserProfile {
  String get avatarUrl;
  String get biography;
}

abstract class Post {
  String get title;
  String get content;
  bool? get isPublished;
}
```

A User object can be rendered into the following Mustache template:

```dart
<h1>{{ name }}</h1>
{{ #profile }}
  <img src=”{{ avatarUrl }}” />
  <p>{{ biography }}</p>
{{ /profile }}
{{ #posts }}
  {{ #isPublished }}
    <div>
      <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
      <p>{{ content }}</h2>
    </div>
  {{ /isPublished }}
{{ /posts }}
```

### Render function

Each generated renderer is paired with a generated _public render function_,
which is the public interface for rendering objects into Mustache templates,
and _private render function_, which is a convenience function for constructing
a renderer and rendering an AST with it.

```dart
String renderUser(User context, Template template) {
  return _render_User(context, template.ast, template);
}

String _render_User(User context, List<MustachioNode> ast, Template template,
    {RendererBase<Object> parent}) {
  var renderer = _Renderer_User(context, parent, template);
  renderer.renderBlock(ast);
  return renderer.buffer.toString();
}
```

In order to use the public render function, one first needs a Template object.
This is a container for a parsed Mustache template. The `Template.parse`
constructor accepts a file path and an optional partial resolver. It parses the
Mustache template at the given file path, and also reads and parses all partials
referenced in the template. The returned Template object contains a mapping of
all partial keys to partial file paths, and also a mapping of all partial file
paths to partial Template objects. This Template object can be used to render
various context objects, without needing to re-read or re-parse the template
file or any referenced partial files.

The `renderUser` function just requires two arguments, the User object to
render, and the Mustache Template object that it should be rendered into.

### Renderer outline

In order to support repeated sections and value sections, a renderer for a type
_T_ requires renderers for other types:

* If _T_ has a getter of type _S_, then a renderer for type _T_ may be called
  upon to render a [value section][] for that getter, which requires a renderer
  for type _S_.
* If _T_ has a getter of type _Iterable&lt;S>_ for some type _S_, then a
  renderer for type _T_ may be called upon to render a repeated section for that
  getter, which requires a renderer for type _S_.

An instance of a renderer needs four things in order to render an object using a
Mustache syntax tree (a _template block_):

* the context object,
* the Mustache template block (a list of nodes),
* the path to the directory in which the Mustache template is located, in order
  to locate partials,
* optionally, a parent renderer

Additionally, a renderer needs various functions in order to render each getter
for the renderer's context type. It may need to render each getter (1) as a
variable, (2) possibly as a conditional section, (3) possibly as a repeated
section, and (4) possibly as a value section).

Here are all of the elements of such a renderer for the User class:

```dart
class Renderer_User extends RendererBase<User> {
  static final Map<String, Property<CT_>> propertyMap<CT_ extends User>() => ...;

  Renderer_User(User context, RendererBase<Object> parent, Template template)
      : super(context, parent, template);

  @override
  Property<User> getProperty(String key) {
    if (propertyMap<User>().containsKey(key)) {
      return propertyMap<User>()[key];
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```

* The base class, **RendererBase**, provides functionality common to all
  renderers, for example a buffer to which output may be written; each of the
  methods discussed in [Rendering a block][] below.
* The map of properties forms the bulk of each individual renderer. The Property
  class is described just below.
* The renderer instance may be asked to render multiple blocks; while rendering
  a list of nodes, the children of certain nodes are rendered without changing
  context, and so can use the same renderer. In particular:
  * when rendering a conditional section,
  * when rendering an inverted repeated section or inverted value section,
  * when rendering a partial.

#### Map of properties

The core functionality of accessing getters on an object by name (as a String)
is a static map of properties for each type which may be used as a context
object during the rendering process. Each getter names is mapped to a Property
object which holds functions that allow performing certain rendering actions
using the given property.

The property map is actually a function because it needs to be type
parameterized on `CT_`, a type variable bounded to the type of the context
object. This is an unfortunate complication which arises from the design of
Property being a collection of functions. Since a renderer can be used to
render _subtypes_ of the context type, we cannot type all of the functions in
the Properties with the context type; they must each be typed with the runtime
type of the context object.

Here is the Property interface:

```dart
class Property<T> {
  final Object Function(T context) getValue;
  final String Function(T, Property<T>, List<String>) renderVariable;
  final bool Function(T context) getBool;
  final Iterable<String> Function(T, RendererBase<T>, List<MustachioNode>)
      renderIterable;
  final bool Function(T) isNullValue;
  final String Function(T, RendererBase<T>, List<MustachioNode>) renderValue;
}
```

For each valid getter on a type, the renderer will map out a Property object
with non-`null` values for the appropriate functions, and `null` values for
inappropriate functions.

##### The `getValue` function

For every valid getter, the Property object will contain a function named
`getValue` which calls the getter and returns the result. This function is used
to render a property in a [variable node][]. For example, the Property for
`name` on the User renderer has the following `getValue` function:

```dart
(CT_ c) => c.name
```

##### The `renderVariable` function

TODO(srawlins): Write.

##### The `getBool` function

For every valid getter with a `bool?` or `bool` return type, the Property object
contains a function named `getBool` which returns the non-`null` `bool` value of
the getter (`null` is converted to `false`). This function is used to render a
property in a conditional section node (or an inverted one). For example, the
Property for `isPublished` on the Post renderer has the following `getBool`
function:

```dart
(CT_ c) => c.isPublished == true
```

##### The `renderIterable` function

For every valid getter with a return type assignable to `Iterable<Object?>?`,
the Property object contains a function named `renderIterable` which requires
some parameters: the context object, the current renderer, and the AST to
render. This function is used to render a property in a repeated section node
(or an inverted one). For example, the Property for `posts` on the User renderer
has the following `renderIterable` function:

```dart
(CT_ c, RendererBase<CT_> r, List<MustachioNode> ast) {
  return c.posts.map(
      (e) => _render_Post(e, ast, r.template, parent: r));
}
```

This function needs the three arguments so that it can iterate over the `posts`
of the context object, and then create new instances of the Post renderer, which
requires the AST to render, and the parent context.

##### The `isNullValue` and `renderValue` functions

For each valid getter which has neither a `bool` return type nor an `Iterable`
return type, the Property object contains a function named `isNullValue` which
returns whether the value of the getter is `null` or not. It also contains a
function named `renderValue` which requires more parameters: the context object,
the current renderer, and the AST to render. These functions are used to render
a property in a value section node (or an inverted one). For example, the
Property for `profile` on the User renderer has the following `isNullValue`
function:

```dart
(CT_ c) => c.profile == null
```

and `renderValue` function:

```dart
(CT_ c, RendererBase<CT_> r, List<MustachioNode> ast) {
  return _render_UserProfile(c.profile, ast, r.template, parent: r);
}
```

The `renderValue` function needs the three arguments so that it can render the
property value using a new `UserProfile` renderer, which requires the AST to
render, and the parent context.

#### Rendering a block

The RendererBase class defines a very simple `renderBlock` method. This method
iterates over an AST, delegating to other methods depending on the type of each
node:

```dart
  /// Renders a block of Mustache template, the [ast], into [buffer].
  void renderBlock(List<MustachioNode> ast) {
    for (var node in ast) {
      if (node is Text) {
        write(node.content);
      } else if (node is Variable) {
        var content = getFields(node);
        write(content);
      } else if (node is Section) {
        section(node);
      } else if (node is Partial) {
        partial(node);
      }
    }
  }
```

Text is rendered verbatim.

Rendering a variable is mostly a matter of resolving the variable (see below).

Sections and Partials are complex enough to warrant their own methods.

#### Resolving a variable key

Rendering a variable requires _resolution_; the variable's _key_ may consist of
multiple _names_, (e.g. `{{ foo.bar.baz }}` is a variable node with a key of
"foo.bar.baz"; this key has three names: "foo", "bar", and "baz") and resolution
may require context objects further down in the stack. This resolution is
performed in the renderer's `getFields` method.

```dart
  String getFields(Variable node) {
    var names = node.key;
    if (names.length == 1 && names.single == '.') {
      return context.toString();
    }
    var property = getProperty(names.first);
    if (property != null) {
      var remainingNames = [...names.skip(1)];
      try {
        return property.renderVariable(context, property, remainingNames);
      } on PartialMustachioResolutionError catch (e) {
        // The error thrown by [Property.renderVariable] does not have all of
        // the names required for a decent error. We throw a new error here.
        throw MustachioResolutionError(...);
      }
    } else if (parent != null) {
      return parent.getFields(node);
    } else {
      throw MustachioResolutionError(...);
    }
  }
```

We can see the entire resolution process here:

* If the key is just ".", then we render the current context object as a String.
* If the first name (which is often the whole key) is found on the context
  object's property map, then we resolve the name as a property on the context
  object.
  * For each remaining name in the key names, we search the resolved object for
    a property with this name. If it is found, we resolve the name as a property
    on the previously resolved object. If it is not found, resolution has
    failed.
* If the first name is not found on the context object, we request that the
  parent renderer resolve the key.
* If there is no parent, resolution has failed.

#### Rendering a section

A section key is not allowed to have multiple names. We first search for a
property on the context object with the key as its name. If we don't find it, we
search the parent context:

```dart
    var key = node.key.first;
    var property = getProperty(key);
    if (property == null) {
      if (parent == null) {
        throw MustachioResolutionError(...);
      } else {
        return parent.section(node);
      }
    }
```

The `getProperty` method returns the Property instance for the specified name,
which has various methods on it which can access the property for various
purposes.

##### Conditional section

First we check if the property can be used in a conditional section:

```dart
    if (property.getBool != null) {
      var boolResult = property.getBool(context);
      if ((boolResult && !node.invert) || (!boolResult && node.invert)) {
        renderBlock(node.children);
      }
      return;
    }
```

If the getter's return type is not `bool?` or `bool`, then `getBool` returns
`null`.

If the getter's return type is `bool?` or `bool`, then `getBool` is a function
which takes the context object as an argument, and returns the non-nullable
`bool` value of the property on the context object (resolving a `null` value as
`false`).

Since a conditional section can be inverted, we have to account for this when
deciding to render the children.

##### Repeated section

If the getter does not result in a conditional section, we check whether it is
iterable:

```dart
    if (property.renderIterable != null) {
      var renderedIterable =
          property.renderIterable(context, this, node.children);
      if (node.invert && renderedIterable.isEmpty) {
        // An inverted section is rendered with the current context.
        renderBlock(node.children);
      } else if (!node.invert && renderedIterable.isNotEmpty) {
        var buffer = StringBuffer()..writeAll(renderedIterable);
        write(buffer.toString());
      }
      // Otherwise, render nothing.

      return;
    }
```

If the getter's return type is not a subtype of `Iterable<Object?>?`, then
`renderIterable` returns `null`.

If the getter's return type is a subtype of `Iterable<Object?>?`, then
`renderIterable`, [detailed here][renderIterable], is a function which returns
the non-nullable String value of the rendered section.

An inverted repeated section is rendered with the current context if the
iterable is `null` or empty.

##### Value section

If the getter does not result in a conditional section, nor a repeated section, we render the section as a value section:

```dart
    if (node.invert && property.isNullValue(context)) {
      renderBlock(node.children);
    } else if (!node.invert && !property.isNullValue(context)) {
      write(property.renderValue(context, this, node.children));
    }
```

An inverted value section is rendered with the current context if the value is
`null`.

The `renderValue` function, [detailed here][renderValue], takes the context
object, the renderer, and the section's children as arguments, and returns the
non-nullable String value of the rendered section.

#### Rendering a partial

A partial key is not resolved as a sequence of names; it is instead a free form
text key which maps to a partial file. Mustachio can either use a built-in
partial resolver, in which case each key is a path which is relative to the
template in which the key is found, or a custom partial resolver which can use
custom logic to map the key to a file path. The keys have been mapped ahead of
time (when the Template was parsed) to paths and the paths have been mapped
ahead of time to Template objects. We map the key to the partial's file path,
and map the partial's file path to the partial's Template:

```dart
  void partial(Partial node) {
    var key = node.key;
    var partialFile = template.partials[key];
    var partialTemplate = template.partialTemplates[partialFile];
    var outerTemplate = _template;
    _template = partialTemplate;
    renderBlock(partialTemplate.ast);
    _template = outerTemplate;
  }
```

To render the partial, we first replace the renderer's template with the
partial's template (for further partial key resolution of any partial tags found
inside this partial) and render the partial with the same renderer, using
`renderBlock`.

### High level design for generating renderers

TODO(srawlins): Write.

## Generated renderer for a specific type and a pre-compiled static template

Mustachio's second set of generated renderers render objects into
ahead-of-time compiled Mustache template blocks. Each template block may be the
content of a Mustache template file, a Mustache partial file, or a Mustache
section.

The mechanics of the tool which generates these renderers is a separate concern
from the mechanics of the renderers themselves. This section is primarily
concerned with documenting how the renderers work. At the end, a higher level
description of the code generator can be found.

### Annotation

The code generation trigger is a `@Renderer` annotation, which specifies a
render function name, a context type, and a template file. The code generator
parses the specified template file, and uses the context type to resolve all tag
keys at the time of code generation. For example, given the following template:

```html
<h1>{{ name }}</h1>
{{ #isFeatured }}<strong>Featured</strong>{{ /isFeatured }}
<div class="posts">
{{ #featuredPost }}<h2>{{ title }}</h2>{{ /featuredPost }}
{{ #posts }}<h2>{{ title }}</h2>{{ /posts }}
</div>
```

The code generator resolves `name` to a String getter on User, `posts` to a
`List<Post>` getter on User, `isPublished` to a `bool` getter on `Post`, and
`title` to a String getter on `Post`. It has all of the information it needs to
write out the logic of the template as a simple state machine. This state
machine is written out as the render function and helper functions for partials:

```dart
String renderUser(User context0) {
  final buffer = StringBuffer();
  // ...
  return buffer.toString();
}
```

The `renderFoo` function takes a `Foo` object, the context object, as
`context0`. Since the context objects exist in a stack and can each be accessed,
we must enumerate them. We write various text to the buffer, according to the
template, and then return the rendered output.

### Rendering plain text

Rendering plain text is as simple as writing it to the buffer:

```dart
  buffer.write('''<h1>''');
```

### Rendering a variable

Rendering a variable requires one or more getter calls. During code generation,
variable keys have been resolved so that the renderer knows the context objects
that provide each getter.

`{{ name }}` compiles to:

```dart
  buffer.write(htmlEscape.convert(context0.name.toString()));
```

This code calls the `name` getter on `conext0`, and then `toString()`. Since
`{{ name }}` uses two brackets, the output must be HTML-escaped. If it were
written `{{{ name }}}`, then the HTML-escaping call would not be made.

### Rendering a section

A section could be a conditional section, a repeated section, or a value
section. The code generator will know, and will write the correct behavior into
the renderer.

#### Rendering a conditional section

`{{ #isFeatured }}<strong>Featured</strong>{{ /isFeatured }}` compiles to:

```dart
  if (context0.b1 == true) {
    buffer.write('''<strong>Featured</strong>''');
  }
```

The text is written only if `b1` is `true` (not `false` or `null`). If the
section were inverted (starting with `{{ ^isFeatured }}`), this would be a
`!= true` check.

#### Rendering a repeated section

`{{ #posts }}<h2>{{ title }}</h2>{{ /posts }}`

compiles to:

```dart
  var context1 = context0.posts;
  if (context1 != null) {
    for (var context2 in context1) {
      buffer.write('''<h2>''');
      buffer.write(htmlEscape.convert(context2.title.toString()));
      buffer.write('''</h2>''');
    }
  }
```

The section contents are written for each value in `context0.posts` (only if
`context0.posts` is not `null`). In order to avoid accessing the getter multiple
times (and to make the value type-promotable), the value is stored in a local
variable.

#### Rendering a value section

`{{ #featuredPost }}<h2>{{ title }}</h2>{{ /featuredPost }}`

compiles to:

```dart
  var context2 = context0.featuredPost;
  if (context2 != null) {
    buffer.write('''<h2>''');
    buffer.write(htmlEscape.convert(context2.title.toString()));
    buffer.write('''</h2>''');
  }
```

The section contents are written only if `context0.featuredPost` is not `null`.
Additionally, the section needs `context0.featuredPost` pushed onto the context
stack, which becomes `context2`. This new context object is used to render the
featured post's `title`.

### Rendering a partial

Partials are allowed to reference themselves, so they must be implemented as new
functions which can reference themselves. This template code:

```html
{{ #posts }}{{ >post }}{{ /posts }}
```

will use a custom partial resolver to resolve `post` to a file at `_post.html`,
which contains the following template:

```html
<h2>{{ title }}</h2>
<p>by {{ name }}</p>
```

These two templates compile into the following two render functions:

```dart
String renderUser(User context0) {
  final buffer = StringBuffer();
  for (var context1 in context0.posts) {
    buffer.write(_renderUser_partial_user_post_0(context1, context0));
  }
  return buffer.toString();
}

String _renderUser_partial_user_post_0(Post context1, User context0) {
  final buffer = StringBuffer();
  buffer.write('''<h2>''');
  buffer.write(htmlEscape.convert(context1.title.toString()));
  buffer.write('''</h2>
<p>by ''');
  buffer.write(htmlEscape.convert(context0.name.toString()));
  buffer.write('''</p>''');
  return buffer.toString();
}
```

Note that the partial function is written to accept each context object as a
separate parameter, so that they are easily accessed by name. `context1` is
accessed in order to write the post's `title`, and `context0` is accessed in
order to write the author's `name`.
